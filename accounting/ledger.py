"""Position ledger and PnL.

Everything here is built from fills the VENUE reported (user socket, or the
REST reconcile backup), never from what the bot intended to do. An order that
was sent is not a fill; a fill at the limit price is not a fill at the fill
price.

Accuracy rules:

* Realized PnL exists only for markets the venue has RESOLVED. Everything
  else is PENDING and reported separately. No settling on a BTC close.
* Unrealized is marked to the live BID (what you could actually get out at),
  not the mid, and is labelled as a mark rather than a result.
* Fees are charged on every fill, taker rate. A missing fee is not a zero fee.
* The ledger persists, so a restart does not lose dedup state and make the
  reconcile backup re-report every historical trade as newly recovered.
* `reconcile_balance()` checks the whole thing against the venue's own USDC
  balance movement. That is the only claim here that does not rest on our own
  bookkeeping being right.
